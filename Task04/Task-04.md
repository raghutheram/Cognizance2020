# Task 4
> ## Description
* Making a basic website using **HTML**
> ## About HTML
* **HTML** is a markup language mainly used for front end Development
> ## Project outcomes
* You'll get to know few commands for **HTML**
* You can create a basic webpage.
> ## Basic Commands list
* <HTML\> this command should be used in the beginning of every HTML file you create and close that you'll have to use </HTML\>.
* <HEAD\> and <HEAD\> are used to write heading for that website.
* <TITLE\> and </TITLE\> are used in between the heading command to write the title of that webpage. You have to write the title of your page between that command.
 * <BODY\> and </BODY\>. We will be writing all our required commands that we want to display in our page between these  commands.
> ## Commands to be used to design our page.
* <h1\> and </h1\> are used for creating headings(which is to be written inside them). You can change the size of the heading by using <h2\> <h3\> till <h6\>.
* <p\> and <p\> are used to write the paragrahs in them which will later be displayed in the webpage.
* <li\> is used to write a point in bullet. 
* To write it in point (i.e use numbers instead of bullets>) we use <li\> between <ol\> and <ol\>
* To post a link of a website we use <a href="link of the website"\> Click on this link!! </a\>.
* To insert an image in the page from our computer we use <img src="link of the image" width="value" length="value"/\>. 
* Use <div\> and </div\> to divide the sentences.
> ## Finally here is the code for the webpage that I've created
```html
